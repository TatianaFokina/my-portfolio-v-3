<p>This is a grid system based on CSS Grid and Bootstrap. Previously Bootstrap uses only CSS Flexbox.</p>

    {% projectDesc "Project Purpose and Goal" %}
        <p>The project is an experiment. I wanted to see the difference between CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid and try something new with Stylus.</p>
        <p>I used basic classes and functions of the Bootstrap 4 grid system, but changed it and customized it with Stylus variables, mixins, and other preprocessor features. I created a landing page with a visualization of the new grid system and with comments.</p>

    {% projectDesc "Web Stack and Explanation" %}
        <p>The stack includes Stylus and Pug for templates. The project is built on Gulp.</p>

{% projectDesc "Problems, Thought Process, and Interesting Features" %}
    <p>Sometimes I've faced problems because there isn't so good and full Stylus documentation. But Google is a good way to fix it.</p>
    <p>There aren't something interesting and extraordinary features on the project page. But in a codebase, you can find a function for the generation of columns in random colors.</p>
{% endprojectDesc %}

{% projectDesc "What I've learned" %}
    <p>This was an interesting and slightly programming experience with Stylus. I've known more about how it works under the hood. And I've learned about a lot of hidden features of the preprocessor.</p>
